# 202512150807 - Technical amendment specification

## Objective

Use the `solarized` color scheme for the site. It should use the light / dark mode combinations. 

NOTE: not all of the *accent tones* need to be incorporated. The *blue* one is a good candidate to incorporate. 

## Technology & Design

- fetch and read: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solarized

## Examples

NOTE: below are examples to get an idea. Especially for the `content` and `background` tones. The proposal doesn't need to use all the used / displayed *accent tones*.
