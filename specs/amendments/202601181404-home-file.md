# 202601181404 - Technical amendment specification

## Objective

Currently the content on the home page is hardcoded. I want to be able to write the contents in a markdown file. Just like the other pages I configure. 

I want to be able to use a `home.md` file that will provide the content of the main `index.html`. 

The parsing of the `home.md` is pretty much the same as for the other content pages. The only difference is that home.md will not get it's own slug. Instead this is actually the root `/`. This should also be reflected in the sitemap. 

If possible hook into the normal parsing of pages. I.e. treat the homepage content and the pages content building as much the same as possible. They only differ in slug. 

## Examples

given my site will have this address: `https://www.aishepherd.nl`
When the user navigates to this site
Then the user will see the contents of the `home.md` parsed as html, just like the other pages.
And the user will see no slug like `https://www.aishepherd.nl/home`
