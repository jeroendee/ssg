# 202512060838 - Technical amendment specification

## Objective

Style wise, `http://localhost:8080` looks exactly like `https://www.qualityshepherd.nl`.

In directory `dev` there is a development version of the site that needs to be built. 

The development version of this site can be inspected by building the site:

```bash
# in directory dev execute:
ssg serve --build
```
Keep in mind that the `ssg` tool has the html templates embedded. 

The site is generated using the Go html templates and the files in `assets`. Any changes to the Go html templates only appear in the development version, after `ssg` has been built again. 

IMPORTANT: The styling needs to be changed. 

It should look exactly like: `https://www.qualityshepherd.nl`

Things that need to change:
- The header text "Quality Shepherd" needs to align to the left with the hav text and the body text. 
- The text spacing in the header and nav is too large right now, it should be more condensed
- etc 

Use Playwright to make comparisons between `http://localhost:8080` and `https://www.qualityshepherd.nl` for other *styling* issues. The *contents* of the sites are different and that's ok. It's the `style` that needs to change.

## Technology

Fetch and read: `https://github.com/janraasch/hugo-bearblog/blob/master/layouts/partials/style.html` => contains the styling `https://www.qualityshepherd.nl` is currently using.

## Examples

## Implementation Plan

### Analysis

**Root Cause:** Production CSS (`assets/style.css`) is missing the header styling block that exists in dev CSS (`dev/assets/style.css`).

| Element | qualityshepherd.nl (target) | localhost:8080 (current) |
|---------|---------------------------|-------------------------|
| Header layout | Flexbox, full-width | No flexbox styling |
| Title alignment | Left-aligned with body | Centered/spaced out |
| Nav links | Underlined, 15px spacing | Not underlined, 10px spacing |
| Logo | 60x60px on right | Small, no size constraint |

### Files to Modify

- `/Users/jeroendee/ACID/40-49/44/44.S/ssg/assets/style.css` - Add header styling block

### Tasks

#### Task 1: Add header styling to production CSS

**Skill:** Invoke `html-css-writer`

Add the following CSS block after line 33 in `assets/style.css` (after `.title span`):

```css
/* Header styling */
header {
  padding: 20px 40px;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
  align-items: center;
  margin: -20px -20px 20px -20px;
  width: calc(100% + 40px);
}

.header-left {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  gap: 8px;
}

.site-title {
  font-size: 1.8rem;
  font-weight: bold;
  text-decoration: none;
}

header nav a {
  text-decoration: underline;
  margin-right: 15px;
}

.header-right {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
}

header .logo {
  width: 60px;
  height: 60px;
}
```

#### Task 2: Rebuild SSG binary

```bash
go build -o /tmp/ssg ./cmd/ssg
```

#### Task 3: Visual verification with Playwright

1. Start dev server: `cd dev && /tmp/ssg serve --build`
2. Navigate to `http://localhost:8080`
3. Take screenshot and compare with `https://www.qualityshepherd.nl`
4. Verify:
   - [ ] Header title "Quality Shepherd" left-aligned with body content
   - [ ] Navigation links underlined and compact (15px spacing)
   - [ ] Logo 60x60px on right side
   - [ ] Overall layout matches reference site
